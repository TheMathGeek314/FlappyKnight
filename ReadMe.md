# FlappyKnight

A mod for the game Hollow Knight.

This mod adds an extra menu option for playing a recreation of the game Flappy Bird in Hollow Knight.
Although it requires an empty save slot to begin, there is no data to save, so the slot will remain empty.
Wings are granted immediately so you can reach the lever above you to start the game.
Your score is tallied by your geo counter, but there are no high scores. If you wish to save a score, you'll have a moment to take a screenshot before returning to the menu.
Difficulty increases as goams move faster over time and spawn closer together, so it is currently impossible to play infinitely without invulnerability cheats.
Taking any damage will immediately end the game, as well as if you fly too high or low offscreen.
